Contributing to nPonysay
We greatly appreciate contributions to ponysay! There are several ways you can help make this project even more magical.
ü¶Ñ Populate Equestria
nPonysay always needs talented artists to create new pony artwork! We welcome ponies from:

My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic - Classic characters and scenes
Other My Little Pony shows - G4, G5, and beyond
Fan media - Original characters and community creations

Getting Started: Check out our documentation for detailed guidelines on creating and formatting pony art for the project. The contributing guide covers technical requirements, art standards, and submission processes.
üìö Maintain the Canterlot Library
Our documentation is continuously evolving and needs regular care:
Language & Style

The manual is written in ponified Queen's British English
Help us maintain consistency throughout all documentation
Report typos, spelling errors, or unclear sections
Suggest better phrasing and clearer explanations

Version Consistency
We maintain multiple formats of our documentation:

Primary version (main reference)
Info version (terminal/CLI format)
HTML version (web format)

If you notice inconsistencies between versions, please:

Submit a patch with corrections
Open an issue describing the problem
Leave detailed comments in commit messages

Translations
While the primary manual updates frequently (making full translations challenging), man page translations are incredibly valuable! We especially welcome contributions for languages where English comprehension varies across age groups.

## Publishing to npm

To publish a new version of the package to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/), follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

- Ensure you have an npm account and are logged in:
  ```sh
  npm login
  ```
- Make sure your local branch is up to date and all changes are committed.

### 2. Update the Version

- Update the `version` field in [`package.json`](ponysay-node/package.json:1) according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):
  ```sh
  npm version [patch|minor|major]
  ```
  This will also create a git tag.

### 3. Build and Test

- Run all tests and build the package to verify everything works:
  ```sh
  npm test
  npm run build
  ```

### 4. Publish

- Publish the package to npm:
  ```sh
  npm publish
  ```
  If publishing a public package for the first time, use:
  ```sh
  npm publish --access public
  ```

### 5. Verify

- Check the package on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) to ensure the new version is available.
- Install the package in a clean environment to verify:
  ```sh
  npm install ponysay-node
  ```

### 6. Common Gotchas

- Make sure you are publishing from the correct directory (where `package.json` is located).
- Ensure your `.npmignore` and [`package.json`](ponysay-node/package.json:1) files are correctly configured to avoid publishing unwanted files.
- If you encounter permission errors, check your npm account permissions and organization settings.
- Only publish stable, tested code‚Äînpm publishes are permanent.

For more details, see the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-publish).
